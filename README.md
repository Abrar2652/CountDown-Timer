## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a simple Count Down Timer created on Android Studio with Kotlin. All UI have been written using Jetpack Compose.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
The interesting part is that I ran this app on my own android phone successfully with both the light and dark theme. It had crashed a lot due to my shortage of technological requirements. It's kind of struggle to learn android development when my RAM and CPU is out of date and I had to face that in real. Due to laptop overheating issues, I had to make sure to save the whole project after several minutes of coding to ensure my project will be safe even if it shuts down suddenly.
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I'm really proud of taking partcipation in Google Android Development Challenge 2021 for the first time. It enabled me to get acquainted with brand new technologies and test it for the first time on my android phone as well. This is my first created android app in my life and the euphoria of running something new coding on my own is inexpressible.
